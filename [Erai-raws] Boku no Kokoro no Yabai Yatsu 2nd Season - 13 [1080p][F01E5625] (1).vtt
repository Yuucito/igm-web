WEBVTT

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.170
Gods above...

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.630
Why do you choose
to put me through such trials?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.250
'Kay, we all good starting off
with juicy love stories, then?

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.130
Quit making it sound like
you're ordering the usual round at a bar.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.170
Oh, oh, me first!

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.210
Yuka it is, then.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.380
Do you have a crush, Yamada?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.790
Ignorance is strength, I guess.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.540
Seems like.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.500
Huh? Wait, what's that mean?

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.790
Okay, how about this?
What sort of guys do you like?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.580
Huh?

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.330
Gods above... Oh, gods above...

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.290
Well? Well? What sorta guy?

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.330
Uh, I guess... The interesting sort?

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.830
Saw that coming.
She's always saying that.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.290
And, I guess...

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.670
a guy who's cat-like?

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.790
You've lost me.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.960
And? What else?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.630
E-enough about me,
what about all of you?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.080
Like, have any of you been asked out?

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.170
I have.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.040
Same.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.460
Well, me too, then.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.330
I haven't.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.960
One of these girls is lying.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.080
Two, I'd say.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.540
Quit the psych test!

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.670
But getting asked out
is pretty childish, anyway.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.790
What? Wait, why? What do you mean?

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.290
Real adults let things slowly brew
until they find themselves

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.540
in that sorta relationship.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.040
Or something like that.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.250
They let it "brew"?

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.380
Sounds like a pain.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.630
W-well I...

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.920
I'd prefer to get asked out!

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.460
What's the matter?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.710
No, nothing.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.750
I just don't really get
how to let things "brew."

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.630
Oh, well you see...

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.130
B-before they even start dating?

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.210
Yup.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.210
She means s*x!

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.460
Adults treat it like
it's some kind of recreational sport.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.170
They use it as a way
to decide if they wanna really go out!

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.670
I'm turning the lights off
before we get in trouble.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.580
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.750
This is bad. I gotta break outta here...

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.710
Maybe I can wait
until they all fall asleep.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.130
But if they notice
I'm not in my room upstairs,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.710
all hell will break loose.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.790
Huh?

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.960
S-s*x!

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.460
What should we do?

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.290
Th-this is bad!

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.630
D-don't think those thoughts!

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.000
C'mon...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.710
Two, three, five... ten?

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.380
Wait, what are prime numbers, again?

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.290
Hey.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.580
Do you think I'm grown up?

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.960
Bwah? Huh?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.710
Wait... now? Here?!

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.170
I want to talk tomorrow

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.960
I want to talk to you about something...

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.790
Hm? What's wrong, Yamada?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.040
Huh?

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.210
No, nothing.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.040
Hmm? Wait...

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.540
Your blankets are huge.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.330
I-I'm done for!

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.250
Huh?!

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.170
What?!

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.170
H-help me...

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.540
What the heck?!

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.500
Ms. Moriya! Ms. Moriya!

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.830
Now's your chance!

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.460
R-right!

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.080
Huh?

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.500
You wanted to talk?

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.210
I-it can wait...

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.420
till tomorrow...

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.380
Okay...

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.830
And so we made it to our group free-time
on the second day.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.210
Now that's a vibe!

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.460
Foxy-fox!

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.630
Foxy-foxy-foxy-fox!

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.920
Quit ruining the mood!
Foxy-foxy-foxy-fox!

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.290
These are holy grounds, y'know!

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.170
They say if a couple
passes through here holding hands,

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.210
they'll be bound together for eternity!

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.830
What? Really?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.290
That sure caught your interest.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.460
Fox!

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.210
Not getting any search results
saying that.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.880
Gah! Who asked you to look it up?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.170
Fox!

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.710
I'm telling you though, there really is-

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.080
I told her we'd talk, but...
I'm telling you though, there really is-

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.420
I told her we'd talk, but...

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.500
How do I bring the audition up?

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.420
What do I even want to talk about?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.630
How I don't want her worrying about me?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.210
How I want her to focus on work?

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.460
I don't know...

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.920
Just...

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.250
If she's only here for my sake...

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.710
I can't take it.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.460
Fox!

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.630
C'mon, let's go.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.750
We haven't had much alone time.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.750
Yeah...

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.960
So? You having fun?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.460
I mean... More than I expected to.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.130
Oh?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.170
That's good, then.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.500
That's...

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.580
I'm happy to hear it.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.710
What's that mean?

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.710
What?

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.500
Just what I said.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.920
Happy and fun.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.040
Okay...

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.000
Then what's that face for?

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.880
N-no reason...

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.040
You had an audition booked, didn't you?

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.290
Yeah.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.880
I'm sorry...

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.670
What are you apologizing to me for?

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.250
I just can't do it!

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.960
I just...

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.080
I really wanted to enjoy our school trip!

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.580
I thought if you were having fun,
then I would too!

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.040
But all I can think about is the audition.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.420
Can you believe how self-centered I am?

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.420
You know, I'm kind of relieved...

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:41.170
Sorry, you probably don't know
how to react to all this.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.750
Turning her back to her job
brings her to tears.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.710
She can't just switch off work mode.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.960
That's the way she is, and why I...

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.880
Why I...

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.670
Agh, hold it in...

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.330
Anna Yamada!

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.790
I'm stronger than you think!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.540
I was alone...

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.580
But I was fine with it.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.920
List of Passing Examinees
To me the world seemed
like nothing more than a filthy mess.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.210
I was a hollow shell, pathetic and weak.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.080
MURDER
ENCYLOPEDIA

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:36.750
I thought everyone was laughing at me
and making fun of me deep down.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.880
I didn't think a single person
wanted to talk to me.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.040
I thought that was just the way
things were.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.670
But...

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.290
I made friends.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.750
Friends like Adachi, Ota, and Kanzaki.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.000
I sometimes talk with Kugenuma
and the guys, now.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.000
I can even talk
somewhat normally with girls.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.290
Our teachers still irk me sometimes,
but I don't hate them.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.080
Where I saw nothing before at school,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.500
bit by bit, I've started noticing things.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.630
Happy things, sad things,
embarrassing things, surprising things.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.000
The once empty world
started to fill with color.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.500
I'll admit it, I like school!

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.000
I still would even without you around!

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.210
Wha-? How could you?

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.380
But it's only because you were.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.580
Huh?

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.790
You showed me this world.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.830
You helped me see how beautiful it is.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.750
Because you're in it.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.500
I like you, Yamada!

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.210
I...

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.750
It's true.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:11.380
I had lost sight of even the regular,
ordinary every day...

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.790
Found 'em!

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.960
Prepare the celebration!

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.960
Wait, Kan-
Prepare the celebration!

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.540
Wait, Kan-

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.330
What?! Were they just holding hands?!

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.830
Y-you think so?

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:32.710
Ever since I met Yamada,
even the mundane feels special.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.830
And maybe this is going too far...

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.500
but it feels like...

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.580
Yamada has made me who I am now.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.000
I just...

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.830
I want to be...

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.830
the smallest...

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.830
tiniest part of her life.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.830
Go for it. Your audition.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.250
It's tomorrow, right?
You can still make it.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.000
Yeah, but-

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.960
Hop on the next bullet train.
I'll tell the teachers.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.380
Here.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.790
That should be enough to get you there.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.290
This is why your bag was so full?

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.630
See ya.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.130
About what you said!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.290
I-I'm just glad...

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.790
to see you're still you.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.250
I...

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.580
I want to say it out loud, too.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.290
Okay...

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.080
So-

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.500
Yamada!

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.830
Chii?

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.670
Everyone's all worked up
saying you're missing.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.380
Decided you want to go
to the audition, didn't you?

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:12.960
Kimi Iro Octave

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.130
Here.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.330
You're gonna want to practice, right?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.830
Yeah...

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.040
I'll put it in here, for you.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.210
I'll even pack these snacks in for you.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.790
Yikes, talk about packed.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.250
I'll handle things here.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.130
Okay...

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.170
Save the tears for later.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.380
Get going!

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.830
I will. Thank you.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.170
Yamada.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.330
It'll be all right.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.750
Yeah!

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.000
Shoot, that was not the sort of thing
I should say in front of Kobayashi...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.040
Ugh, can hardly call myself leader
after ditching my group like this, huh?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.330
I wouldn't say that.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.380
Yikes, I really gotta get back.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.330
Daichi Cram School
Get into elite schools

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.420
I really gotta think of an excuse.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.960
Maybe I'll say I walked Yamada to the
station because she had an emergency.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.710
No, but that's basically
putting the blame on her.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.960
Big congratulations!
Give us a kiss!

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.000
Congrats!

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.080
No, no, this isn't right!

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.170
What isn't? They're a couple.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.790
But they aren't even in the same class!

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.710
No! No!
Can you please stop this?

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.420
I'm telling you, it's wrong!
Can you please stop this?

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.000
I'm telling you, it's wrong!

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.670
Honestly, please?

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.290
Yeah...

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.880
Sorry...

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.040
Hara's as strong as they come.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:01.840
I hope I pass
the entrance exams

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.420
There.
Kyotaro Ichikawa

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.790
Hmm...

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.130
Maybe something like this?

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.630
Oh...

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.380
Hello?

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.540
Make sure you get me something good, okay?

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.380
I don't want some dumb keychain
of a robo-Kiyomizu-dera

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.130
with someone hopping off, you hear me?

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.250
Make it something good like that
Gionido oil blotting paper, 'kay?

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.920
And those jari-manju snacks
and the Ranran scented sachets!

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.170
And maybe a bottle gourd?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.920
Okay, let's see here...

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080
Wuzzat?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.250
A present. For my sister.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.540
Oh, your sister!

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.210
Why's that got you more interested?

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.040
Chill out, you two!

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.000
Hey! Quit playing with the merchandise!

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.170
And you girls cut it out!

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.420
Kyoto Souvenirs

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.670
Yamada called her parents right away,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.670
who then called the teachers.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.380
And so she made it safely to her audition.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.290
Anna!
And so she made it safely to her audition.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.460
And so she made it safely to her audition.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.960
Papa! Mama!
And so she made it safely to her audition.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.130
It's fun enough
even without Yamada around.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:10.880
But...

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:11.840
Anna Yamada
I'm headed out

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.330
K
Meet you at
the usual spot

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.630
Still...

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.420
Listen up, our trip is not over
until you're all back home.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.420
Even still...

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.500
I just want to be with her!

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.920
But...

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.960
Where's our "usual" spot?

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.540
Where does she mean?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.330
Where?

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.630
She couldn't mean...

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.420
Library

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.380
You're brave coming in here
out of uniform.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.960
Did you get it right away?

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.630
Not exactly.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.080
Lots of places to choose from...

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.670
But...

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.000
Meet you at the usual spot

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.750
With all your illicit snacking here,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.330
Jagareko Veggie
Potato Chips
Consomme Home Run

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.000
I figured the library.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.130
You're on the books for it, and all.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.040
Hmm?

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.880
That pun was unintentional, okay?

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.330
So your audition...

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.330
What?

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.460
I still don't know. I did my best, but...

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.330
Y-yeah?

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.330
What?

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:17.080
This time around showed me
I'm such a weakling.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.080
That's not true...

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.960
Always wishy-washy and jealous of people.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.750
Thinking negative thoughts
that get me anxious.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.580
I'm a mess...

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.880
But I like who I am!

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.250
I think I've finally realized that.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.500
And so...

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.500
That's why...

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:52.130
Everything around me is so important,
and so special, and so lovely to me.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.670
Kyotaro Ichikawa.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.750
You made me realize who I am.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.540
Kyotaro Ichikawa.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.290
You're more important than anything.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.710
More special than anyone.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.290
You're my everything.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.130
We...

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.630
Fell In Love

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.670
And I love you!

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.580
Will you...

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.040
go out with me?

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.920
Wha...

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.830
I...

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.630
Yes...

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.290
Ow!

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.000
Yippee!

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.380
I really am messed up in the head.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.130
There's no way any of this is real.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.670
Yet even still...

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.880
This is...

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.790
How I...

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:07.420
We...

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.630
How we...

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.080
Fell in Love

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.500
...fell in love.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.130
I, We, Fell in Love
